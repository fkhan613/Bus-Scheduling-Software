# Bus Scheduling Software

This is a Bus Scheduling Software that can potentially be used for commercial use. You can create routes, add buses to routes, add passengers to buses and delete buses, routes and passenegrs. This software uses a txt file database so even if the program is closed, the data will still be saved and can be reloaded.

To test this software out, fork the repository and run it in your terminal.
